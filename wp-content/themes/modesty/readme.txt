-- Restrictions --

This theme has some restrictions due to design and other reasons.

1. actually a descision

There are two custom index templates. You can choose between “index-big” and “index-tiny” in the index.php. Give it a try.

INSTRUCTION:
Open "index.php" in an editor of your choice or in wordpress's editor(Appearance -> Editor).
In "get_template_part(#here#)" you can write 'index-big' or 'index-tiny'.
As a standart it is set to 'index-big'.
Don't forget to save.

2. gallery

Due to design a gallery only supports 3 columns.

3. thumbnails

This theme currently does not support post thumbnails.
It will support those in the near future.

4. sidebar

There is no sidebar how you would expect it.
It is positioned in the footer. 

5. widgets

The size of a widget is 400x400 px.
If there is more content, you can scroll in the widget.

6. width

The maximum width of the content containers is 960px.
